# What's New?

# Built by Allison Wagner

What's New is an application designed to display your current news. This application was built with `create-react-app` and is my first app using with the React framework.

### Focus
The focus of this project is on understanding how to pass information through props, break an application down into logical componenets and write organized JSX. All while writing clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax. It is also an introduction to testing in the React framework. Snapshot tests, as well as testing of methods, and changes in state, were utilized.

### Languages & Technologies Used

- React
- CSS/SCSS
- Webpack
- Testing with Jest/Enyzme
